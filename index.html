    <h1>About me </h1>
    <p>After a successful career in collegiate events, I've decided to take a bit of a left-turn in my career and pursue work in the tech industry. I'm leaning into some of the skills I honed as an event coordinator- problem solving, collaboration, and project management- and merging it with some of my intersts outside of work- tinkering/fixing things, following technology, and learning new things.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Located in Portland, OR (although original from the midwest)</li>
      <li>Extensive background in large-scale events and higher education</li>
        <ul>
          <li>I have worked for the University of Iowa, Portland State Univeristy, and most recently Reed College.</li>
          <li>Directed capstone events for colleges and universities (Commencement, Reunions, Orientation)</li>
          <li>Managed large, multiple-day conferences</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Intersted in technology and tinkering with things</li>
      <li>Hobbies include:<li>
          <ul>
        <li>bicycles and biking
        <li>attempting to fix things around the house and garage</li>
