      <div id="about">
        <p>After a successful career in collegiate events, I've decided to take a bit of a left-turn in my career and pursue work in the tech industry. I'm leaning into some of the skills I honed as an event coordinator- problem solving, collaboration, and project management- and merging it with some of my intersts outside of work- tinkering/fixing things, following technology, and learning new things. My goals at epicodus are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Learn how to think like a programmer.</li>
          <li>Get familiar with several basic languages/technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Ruby).</li>
          <li>Have fun practicing concepts and building things.</li>
          <li>Get a job in the tech field!</li>
        </ol>
