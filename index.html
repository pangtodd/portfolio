    <h1>About me</h1>
    
    <p>After a successful career in collegiate events, I've decided to take a bit of a left-turn in my career and pursue work in the tech industry. I'm leaning into some of the skills I honed as an event coordinator- problem solving, collaboration, and project management- and merging it with some of my intersts outside of work- tinkering/fixing things, following technology, and learning new things.</p>
